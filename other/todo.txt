- turn clustering into a function that accepts a df and vector of columns to cluster on
- cluster with the same number of clusters as style_collapsed and compare
  - cluster on just selected styles

- tsne
- adversarial networks
	- name generator
	
- get other ingredients (yeast, spices)

- which hops are used most often in which styles?
  - are they predictive?

 Itâ€™d be fun if you could also look at individual beers (maybe with tooltips), or maybe even search for particular beers. You could then report how close a particular beer is to the center of its cluster (i.e. how much of an IPA a particular IPA is).

not sure if you have any consumption data, but I think it'd be interesting to see where various beers are consumed / produced and if those match up.  If so, did producers start producing more beers because of local preferences or did preferences change from availability
